Introduction

The run_analysis.R script is made to perform the following steps:
 	1.-Looks into the project files and merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2.- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	3.-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the activity_labels data set file.
	4.-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
Variables
labels: store the levels "WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING
"
features: store the variables of the Dataset
x_test,y_test,subject_train, subject_test, x_train and y_train store the variables in the train and test datasets
totalSubject: stores the values for each of the subjects
total_x,total_y: merge the values of x_test,y_test,x_train and y_train
total_bind: stores the complete data set that joins the train and test datasets
x: looks for the observations in the feautures dataset that fulfill the requirements
Data: select the columns of total_bind that fulfill x requirements
